      Happy Birthday, Hanu! 🎉 I am really happy I knew you. From the very first day, your kindness and support have been something I could always count on. You have this rare gift — when I talk to you, I feel peace. It’s like the world gets quieter, and everything feels a little lighter. Even though I can’t always be right there with you, I want you to know how grateful I am that you were born. You make life brighter, funnier, and so much more meaningful. On your special day, I just want you to feel loved, celebrated, and appreciated—because you truly deserve it. May this year bring you happiness, success, and endless reasons to smile. 

      You’ve been more than just a friend to me; you’ve been a blessing, someone who brings warmth, joy, and strength into my life. Your kindness inspires me, your support lifts me up, and your presence makes everything better. 

      I wish you a lot of things, actually — but most of all, I wish you to live the life you’ve always wanted. A satisfied life. A life that makes you smile when you look back after you grow old. A life that makes you feel like “enkuan tefeterku 😊”. 

      And when you miss me, remember — I’m probably missing you too. Distance can be tough, but it can never erase how much you mean to me. You’re always with me in my thoughts, in my laughter, and in my heart. Missing you isn’t an empty feeling—it’s proof that what we share is real and special. 

      When life feels heavy, please remember—you are stronger than you think. I believe in you, even on days when you don’t believe in yourself. You’ve already overcome so much, and I know you’ll get through this too. 

      When boredom sneaks in, don’t forget: you’re one of the most interesting, creative people I know. Put on our favorite song, rewatch that show we always talk about, or just send me a random voice note. I’ll always be there. 

      And for the days when you forget your own worth—here’s your reminder: You are smart. You are kind. You are beautiful. You are loved. You inspire me more than you realize. Never let self-doubt make you forget who you are—you’re one of a kind, and the world is better with you in it. 

      If it’s late and you can’t sleep, imagine us sitting under the stars, talking softly about nothing and everything. The world is quiet, the night is calm, and you feel safe. Close your eyes, breathe slow, and let that peace carry you into sleep. Sweet dreams, Hanu. 🌙✨ 

      And when you find yourself overthinking, please remember: not every thought is truth, not every worry is worth your energy. Take it one step at a time. You’ve got this. And you don’t have to figure it all out alone—I’ll always be here to listen. 

      Finally, when you’re feeling grateful, let me join you. Because I’m grateful for you—your laughter, your patience, the way you light up my days. You’ve made my life better in ways you probably don’t even realize, and I’ll always cherish having you as part of my world. 

      Enkuan tewoledk, Hanu! 🎉🎂 Eyuyyeeeee luv ya ❤️😘😊 

      Here’s to many more memories, laughter, and adventures together. 

      Always,  
      Eyob 💌
